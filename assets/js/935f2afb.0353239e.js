Radiosity can handle rendering diffuse surfaces very well while being viewpoint independent, having natural color bleeding and soft shadows. Yet it is seldom used because of how computationally intensive it is.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"our":{"id":"our","title":"Our Implementations","description":"APIs and Libraries used :","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"radiosity":{"id":"radiosity","title":"Radiosity","description":"Radiosity is a global illumination algorithm where every surface is assumed to be an ideal Lambertian surface, which means that every surface reflects light equally in all directions. This means that radiosity by itself cannot handle specular reflections and is thus not good for modeling glossy surfaces.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"references":{"id":"references","title":"References","description":"- Cohen, M.
